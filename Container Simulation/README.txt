Test_Script.py, Ball.py and Simulation.py must be placed in the same folder.
Test_Script.py goes through all the tests and produces all the plots required.
Test_Script.py is in sections so each test/plot can be run individually.
Other than the first section of code in Test_Script.py which imports the modules,
the sections of code may be run in any order.
In Test_Script.py some plots take a few minutes to produce. There is a line in each section
which produces a plot that defines the balls. It looks like 'balls = Balls(n).balls'.
The value of n may be reduced to produce similar plots but reduce the time.
